### Unfulfilled Plans.

Have you ever been in the midst of a plan and thought…I am waiting for “X” to happen and then I will start or do “Z”? That’s pretty much where I am at. Approximately one year ago, my best friend and husband (for 24 years at that point) and I decided that we were “over” the 9-5 job, the big mortgage and the stationary life we were in the thick of. We had talked for nearly six months about what we could do to change the course we were on. We both love traveling and wanted to be able to do more of it but in our current home and careers, we were unable to do much. We went around and around with changes to lifestyle or jobs that could increase our ability to see and do more things together. We finally came to the conclusion that we were going to sell our house and go fulltime in an RV. Now, what does this have to do with the question about waiting for “X to do Z?” I have been waiting to start blogging for the sale of our sticks and bricks and getting out on the road. Well, like I said, this plan hatched about twelve months ago. Yep! Still waiting for our beautiful home and property to sell. I am not a very patient person, and this has not sat well with me but what does a gal do? Continue to wait…patiently….sort of….not really.

## Here’s some background info

I am a registered nurse and I was a director for a home health and hospice company and I quit my job and took a travel nursing gig for five months, thinking that surely our home would sell, and my hubby would join me in our new, rockin’ RV. It didn’t and so he didn’t. He does sales and service for a medical device company and can travel from anywhere and so between his career and mine, we can essentially live anywhere we would like. See why RV life is perfect for us? What is wrong with the universe? Why hasn’t this happened yet? Maybe it’s because we currently live where most people vacation.

### Elevation, Views, and Wildlife

We live at 8600’ in the mountains, surrounded by “quakies” and pines off of a dirt road. There is a ton of wildlife that includes moose, bears, badgers, deer and porcupines. We can hear the elk bugle in the early morning hours at the end of August and early part of September. The fall colors are AMAZING and vibrant shades of yellow and orange. And when it SNOWS! Imagine driving between white walls of snow that are taller than your jeep! We had over 30 FEET of snow at one point. And even with all of this crazy, wonderful piece of heaven where we live, we still want to sell everything and hit the road.
